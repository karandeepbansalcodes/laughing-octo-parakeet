### **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)**
#### **Title**: Implement Synthetic Monitoring in Nexus for Package Upload and Download Times

**Date**: [Insert Date]

#### **Context**
In our current environment, monitoring package management operations within the Nexus repository is critical to ensure reliable and efficient software delivery. Specifically, understanding the upload and download performance is essential, as these times impact build efficiency and developer productivity. Synthetic monitoring is proposed to capture metrics on upload and download times by simulating package pull, build, and publish operations to the Nexus repository. 

The primary goals are:
- To monitor and alert on upload/download performance and detect issues proactively.
- To provide visibility through dashboards in Kibana to assess performance trends and anomalies over time.

#### **Decision**
Implement synthetic checks in Nexus to:
1. **Simulate Package Operations**: Regularly run synthetic tests to perform pull, build, and publish operations on test packages within the Nexus repository.
2. **Capture Performance Metrics**: Record the time taken for upload and download actions and log any related errors.
3. **Integrate with Observability Stack**:
   - Send these metrics to Elasticsearch for analysis and long-term storage.
   - Build Kibana dashboards to visualize upload and download trends.
   - Set up alerts in Kibana based on thresholds for upload/download times to trigger notifications for performance degradations.

#### **Alternatives Considered**
1. **Rely on Existing Logs**: Use raw Nexus logs to capture upload and download times.  
   - *Rejected* as this approach lacks granularity and may not provide real-time monitoring for proactive alerting.
2. **External Monitoring Solutions**: Use an external tool to monitor Nexus repository performance.
   - *Rejected* due to added complexity, licensing costs, and the desire to centralize monitoring within the existing observability stack.

#### **Consequences**
- **Positive**:
  - Improved visibility into Nexus repository performance.
  - Proactive alerting on upload/download issues, helping to minimize impact on CI/CD pipelines.
  - Historical data for analysis and identifying long-term performance trends.

- **Negative**:
  - Overhead of creating and managing synthetic checks, which could marginally increase resource usage.
  - Potential for false positives if synthetic checks experience transient network or infrastructure issues.

#### **Status**
*Proposed* - This decision is pending final approval and alignment with application owners and observability stakeholders.

#### **Next Steps**
1. Design and configure synthetic checks to simulate package operations in Nexus.
2. Integrate synthetic monitoring results with Elasticsearch.
3. Develop Kibana dashboards and define alerting thresholds based on acceptable upload/download times.
4. Review and iterate based on feedback from observability and application teams.
